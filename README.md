# Illedran's Github homepage

This page contains a small list of projects that are close to my heart.

 * [My BSc thesis](static/pdf/new_physics_detection.pdf): `New physics detection in High Energy 
 Physics experiments through unsupervised Deep Learning` with which I graduated on March 20th 2017
 with 110 out of 110 cum laude.
 * [RaftScope](raftscope): RaftScope is a visualizer of the Raft consensus algorithm. It was originally
 created by Diego Ongaro ([@ongardie](https://github.com/ongardie)). As part of the Distributed Algorithms course at the
 University of Trento we (me, [@MartinBrugnara](https://github.com/MartinBrugnara) and [@FataHoxha](https://github.com/FataHoxha))
 expanded RaftScope with additional functionality as explained in the original PhD dissertation.
 * [pgRouting](https://pgrouting.org/): pgRouting extends the PostGIS / PostgreSQL geospatial database to provide 
 geospatial routing functionality. I worked on adding max-flow and related algorithms to pgRouting as part of my work 
 during [Google Summer of Code 2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/projects/6192757919973376/).
